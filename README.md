# Riffle-Getting-Started
Arduino Sketches for "Riffle Getting Started"

# Quick Start

### Hardware prep

- Insert a microSD card and a coin cell into the appropriate locations on the Riffle.

- Insert a lithium ion battery into the appropriate JST connector on the Riffle (labeled 'Lith/USB' on the back of the board).

- Make sure that the switch on the Riffle is switched to the side labeled 'Lith/USB'.

### Software prep

- Make sure that the Arduino IDE (version 1.6.10 or higher) is installed.  If it
 isn't, get it [here](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software).

- Copy all of the folders in 'arduino_libraries' into the 'libraries' folder inside the 'sketchbook' folder associated with the Arduino IDE install.  These libraries are necessary for running the 'temp_logger.ino' and 'set_rtc.ino' sketches in this repo.  

- Use the 'set_rtc.ino' sketch to set the RTC ('Real Time Clock') on the Riffle to the current time.
